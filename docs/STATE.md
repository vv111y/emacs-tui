# Project state

Updated 2026-10-24 (America/Toronto).

## Active implementation

PR #18 merged at `ee7066847518c36c639b76ad6d9bac5ac977fdb1` after independent
review and final-head CI [40065371481](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/actions/runs/40065371481).
All eight jobs passed. Seven runtime jobs each ran 218 ERT tests, strict
compilation/checkdoc, six PTY scripts and five-workload benchmark protocol
smoke; the package job built/clean-installed on 31.1 and 28.1.

Current work removes full row reconstruction from selection navigation. Full
renders prepare item bounds, then a buffer-local overlay supplies selection
highlighting without altering application text properties. Navigation reuses
valid bounds and updates native point/window point. External character edits
invalidate the cache; fallback rendering stages selection before committing.
Full source/query/sort/mark/tree updates still prepare and replace contents.
Overlay positions are restored if an atomic buffer edit fails.

Local Emacs 29.3 passes 228 ERT tests, strict compilation, checkdoc and six
PTY scripts. Ten new regressions cover unchanged content/properties/hooks,
Unicode/multiline rows, projection-free table navigation, query/sort/source
replacement, external edits, preview transitions/disposal, tree marks and
failed-update rollback. Independent review found that a list-to-identical-text transition retained
its highlight. Successful text renders now retire list state even when no
buffer replacement is needed; a regression retains preview point/tick while
checking the overlay/cache are removed. Review also found narrowing could hide
a newly selected row; cached navigation now widens, matching full-list rendering,
with a regression asserting actual buffer/window point and unchanged characters.
Corrected review/CI are pending.
An interpreted-source before/after navigation baseline (1,000/10,000 rows,
100 measured samples plus 10 warmups) is in progress; no numbers are claimed
yet. Benchmark methodology and limits are in docs/PERFORMANCE.md.

Next: publish raw before/after evidence, resolve review feedback, then broaden
stress/display validation and address the next measured cost. Public-history,
human-review and actual MELPA acceptance remain external gates.

## Implementation and handoff

This is an experimental development release, not a stable or MELPA package.

Scope clarification from the owner, 2026-10-23: build a general-purpose TUI
toolkit for Emacs. The ephemeral XOB-style workflow is one supported application
pattern. Persistent applications and embedded panels must not require query
input, an origin marker, or commit-then-close. See docs/DESIGN.md and the new
immediate priorities in ROADMAP.md. PR #6 merged the persistent lifecycle and
dashboard. PR #7 added borrowed-window embedding over the same primitives.

- [PR #1](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/1): merged foundation with
  editable temporary queries, independent list/text views, explicit selection
  and atomic origin-buffer commit, columns/rows/grid, native child frames and
  an ordinary-window fallback.
- [PR #2](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/2): merged automatic resize
  reflow, state preservation, owned-subtree invalidation and real TTY resizing.
- [PR #3](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/3): merged debounced async
  providers with cancellation, streaming replacement updates, obsolete callback
  rejection, failure recovery and a chunked buffer-search example.
- [PR #4](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/4): merged opt-in
  multi-selection, stable identity marks, non-color indicators and explicit
  batch commits. Final-head CI also passed on all four supported test versions.
- [PR #5](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/5): merged by the owner;
  general-purpose toolkit scope and lifecycle priorities are now on main.
- [PR #6](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/6): persistent lifecycle,
  dashboard, explicit actions and application cleanup.
- [PR #7](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/7): borrowed-window embedding
  and host restoration without changing host buffer contents.
- [PR #8](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/8): composed application/view
  keymaps and a public current-session accessor.
- [PR #9](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/9): sortable table columns,
  structured dashboard rows and failure-safe updates.
- [PR #10](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/10): preview reading position
  survives focus changes and unchanged updates.
- [PR #11](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/11): native editable inputs,
  application change callbacks and a persistent composer with explicit copying.
- [PR #12](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/12): finite tree views, stable
  expansion/hidden marks, ancestor search context and a buffer-tree application.
- [PR #13](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/13): maximize/restore and
  per-view hidden reading state, including native background input edits.
- [PR #14](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/14): required ARM64 macOS
  30.2/31.1 validation alongside the four-version Linux matrix.
- [PR #15](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/15): independent per-view
  queries and native persistent search composition without replacing sources.
- [PR #16](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/16): explicit named context
  actions over marks/current objects with native-menu target revalidation.
- [PR #17](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/17): real candidate-recipe
  builds, clean archive installations and declared-floor Emacs 28.1 CI.
- [PR #18](https://github.com/vv111y/emacs-tui/pull/18): real native-key/PTY
  benchmark with separate command/render/provider stages and source provenance.

API and runnable examples are in README.md. `make demo` explores an in-memory
sample graph; `make async-demo` searches buffer snapshots. Marks are per view
and preserve local filtered-hidden selections. Source replacement prunes absent
identities; async query supersession clears provider-owned results and marks.
The graph demo deliberately filters only nodes so forward/backlinks remain
navigable. Query edits there may prune marks as its source results change.

## Validation

Current evidence is recorded above. Runtime CI covers Linux Emacs 28.1,
28.2, 29.4, 30.2 and 31.1, plus ARM64 macOS 30.2 and 31.1. Each job runs ERT,
strict compilation, checkdoc and six real terminal scripts. Emacs 31.1 uses
native TTY child frames for ephemeral/persistent/input/tree interfaces on both
platforms; earlier versions use windows. Embedded/table scripts borrow a
window. Resize coverage is 120x40 -> 90x30 -> 140x45, including maximize/restore
and explicit action-menu invocation. A real `cat` subprocess test covers
streaming and disposal. The separate package job builds the candidate archive
and clean-installs the same tar on 31.1 and the declared 28.1 floor.

Package-lint at upstream commit `1865be780a16098f972fef50a52b21ca6ee04df9`
was rerun against the current action implementation. Its only findings are the two warnings
that `emacs` is redundant in the main/layout package names; the table and tree modules
are clean. This remains a packaging question, not an overall clean lint pass.
The extracted local runtime disables native compiler trampoline generation
because it has no configured native compiler toolchain.

## Remaining work

1. Extend application controls
   through concrete consumers. Preserve ephemeral behavior. Extend layouts, history, per-view
   input, maximize/restore and tree/form controls as real consumers require them. Avoid treating every preview as navigation.
2. Broaden actual display validation: GUI child frames, macOS terminal emulators,
   multiplexers, narrow screens, multiple clients/terminals and visual behavior.
   Linux PTY smoke is not complete UI QA.
3. Measure large-result rendering, input-to-display latency and allocations.
   List/table rendering currently replaces full view contents; unchanged text
   previews avoid replacement. Async providers remain
   cooperative and must return promptly; cancellation must stop their own
   processes/timers. Snapshot acquisition in the async demo is synchronous.
4. Resolve the package-name lint question, document API/migration stability and accumulate
   real usage. Continue through ROADMAP.md; no performance or maturity claim
   has been established.

## External gates and continuity

MELPA guidance was rechecked on 2026-10-24: public maintenance of at least one
month and human review expectations remain. Earliest known time eligibility is
approximately 2026-11-23, not a promised completion date. Autonomous reviews do
not satisfy the human-review expectation. See docs/MELPA.md for source links;
never claim acceptance from a submission alone.

Work continues hourly Monday through Saturday. No Sunday work or notifications
(America/Toronto). Scheduled sessions are discrete, not an uninterrupted daemon.
The owner expects to check in Saturday 2026-10-24 around 09:00; that is not a stop
time. Treat recently updated active drafts as claimed scope, use expected-head
leases, and leave actual test evidence and remaining work in this file.
